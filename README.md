# Wontae Choi SimpleGameHosting Developer Coding Assignment

### Implementation

- Implementation agenda at each PRs and commits can be found at [PRs](https://github.com/wontae-gramin9/sgh/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed).
- Each commit has its own agenda, so that it is easy to present my thought process and reasons for writing code at each steps.
  - As much as it can be found on the commit history of the repository, as many branches have been merged to the main, it can be better easily viewed on any Git GUI program. In my case, I use SourceCode.
